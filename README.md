FAQ:

Q. "Why are these not in the http://github.com/openSUSE/artwork repository?"

A. The openSUSE/artwork github repository is a creative 'free-for-all' for all of our openSUSE artwork contributors. The long term goal of the openSUSE project is to have a special 'curated' location for 'official' openSUSE materials. This location is a temporary prototype for these initial materials before a more permenant home is found, most likely with Guidelines and more detailed instructiosn for use.
